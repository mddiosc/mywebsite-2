## Welcome to my personal blog

This is my first blog post. Here I'll share my experiences, learnings, and reflections about web development and technology in general.

## What can you expect?

In this blog you'll find:

- **Technical tutorials** about React, TypeScript, and modern technologies
- **Personal reflections** about software development
- **Interesting projects** I'm working on
- **Tips and tricks** I've learned along the way

## My experience

With over 5 years in front-end development and solid training in modern technologies like React, Next.js, and TypeScript, I hope to add value to the community.

I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy writing!
