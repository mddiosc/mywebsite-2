## The perfect combination

React and TypeScript form a powerful combination for developing modern web applications. In this post I share my experience working with these technologies.

## Benefits of TypeScript in React

### 1. Early error detection

TypeScript allows us to detect errors at compile time, significantly reducing bugs in production.

### 2. Better development experience

Auto-completion and code navigation greatly improve productivity.

### 3. Safe refactoring

Changes in interfaces and types propagate automatically, making refactoring more reliable.

## Best practices

- Use clear interfaces for props
- Leverage TypeScript utility types
- Configure ESLint and Prettier for consistency
- Use React.FC sparingly (prefer normal functions)

## Conclusion

The initial investment in learning TypeScript is completely worth it. Type safety and better DX compensate for the initial setup time.
