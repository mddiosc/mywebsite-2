Fourteen years ago, I woke up every morning thinking about airport codes, flight fares, and the infinite complexity of Amadeus reservation systems. Today I wake up thinking about React components, custom hooks, and how to optimize web application performance.

This is the story of how I got here, and why I chose the technologies you see in this portfolio.

## The Amadeus years: More than flight reservations

For over a decade, I worked in the tourism industry, specializing in GDS (Global Distribution System) systems, particularly Amadeus. For those unfamiliar, Amadeus is one of the world's most complex systems: it connects airlines, hotels, travel agencies, and processes millions of transactions daily.

Working with Amadeus taught me valuable lessons that I apply in frontend development today:

### **Precision under pressure**

In tourism, an error can mean a family loses their vacation or a company faces significant losses. This "zero-errors" mindset I carry with me when writing code: exhaustive testing, data validation, edge case handling.

### **Complex systems, simple interfaces**

Amadeus handles enormous complexity behind the scenes, but the interface must be simple so a travel agent can use it efficiently. This is exactly what I seek in React: abstracting complexity into reusable components that are easy to use.

### **Performance is critical**

When you have thousands of users querying flight availability simultaneously, every millisecond counts. This experience makes me value tools like React Query for intelligent caching and Vite for ultra-fast builds.

## The turning point: Modern JavaScript

The change began when I started automating repetitive processes in my work with JavaScript. I was fascinated by the possibility of creating solutions that previously required expensive proprietary software.

What made me fall in love with frontend development was the **immediacy of visual feedback**. In tourism, the results of your work were often seen weeks later. With React, you change a line of code and see the result instantly.

## Why React and TypeScript?

After experimenting with vanilla JavaScript, Vue, and Angular, React became my choice for several reasons:

### **Mature ecosystem**

After 14 years in an industry where stability is crucial, I greatly value the React ecosystem. Tools like Next.js, React Query, and Framer Motion have proven their worth in real projects.

### **TypeScript: Lessons from critical systems**

In Amadeus, a type error could cause massive problems. TypeScript gives me that same confidence in the frontend: errors caught at compile time, intelligent autocompletion, safe refactoring.

### **Components as building blocks**

GDS systems are built with reusable modules. React Components follow the same philosophy: create once, use in multiple places, maintain consistency.

## Technical decisions for this portfolio

Building this portfolio was a perfect opportunity to apply everything I learned. Here are the key decisions:

### **React 19 + TypeScript 5.7**

- **Why?** Latest features like Server Components and better performance
- **Tourism lesson:** Always use stable but modern versions

### **Vite instead of Create React App**

- **Why?** Ultra-fast build times, instant HMR
- **Tourism lesson:** Development speed directly impacts productivity

### **TailwindCSS for styling**

- **Why?** Visual consistency, utility-first approach
- **Tourism lesson:** Scalable systems need clear and consistent rules

### **React Query for server state**

- **Why?** Intelligent caching, automatic retry, synchronization
- **Tourism lesson:** Critical data needs robust error handling

### **Framer Motion for animations**

- **Why?** Native performance, declarative API
- **Tourism lesson:** Microinteractions improve user experience

### **React Router 7**

- **Why?** Type-safe navigation, nested routes
- **Tourism lesson:** Navigation should be intuitive and predictable

## Project architecture

```text
src/
├── components/          # Reusable components
├── pages/              # Main pages/views
├── hooks/              # Reusable business logic
├── lib/                # Utilities and configurations
├── types/              # TypeScript definitions
└── i18n/               # Internationalization
```

This structure reflects my experience in enterprise systems: clear separation of responsibilities, easy maintenance, scalability.

## Key lessons from the transition

### **1. Enterprise experience is valuable**

Don't dismiss your previous experience. The 14 years in tourism gave me perspective on critical systems, stakeholder management, and thinking at scale.

### **2. Continuous learning is essential**

In tourism, regulations change constantly. In frontend, technologies evolve rapidly. The mindset is the same: adapt and keep learning.

### **3. Fundamentals matter more than trends**

Instead of chasing every new framework, I focused on mastering JavaScript, TypeScript, and React principles. Solid fundamentals allow you to adapt to any tool.

### **4. User experience is universal**

Whether facilitating a flight booking or navigating a web application, it's always about solving real problems for real people.

## What's next?

This blog will be where I share:

- **React patterns** I've found useful in real projects
- **Architecture decisions** and their trade-offs
- **Tools and workflows** that improve productivity
- **Lessons learned** from both successful and failed projects

## Final reflection

Changing careers at 30+ isn't easy, but my experience in tourism wasn't wasted time—it was preparation. Complex systems, attention to detail, and focus on the end user are invaluable transferable skills.

If you're considering a similar transition, my advice is: leverage your unique experience. The tech world needs diverse perspectives, and your background will give you advantages others don't have.
